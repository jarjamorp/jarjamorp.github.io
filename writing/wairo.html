    <h2>On Creating A Breakthrough Technology</h2>
    <p>Nov 2023.</p>
    <p>
      Earlier this year, I was sick and bed ridden. 
      Bored, I thought I'd write some thoughts down about my startup, Wairo. 
      At the time I happened to be reading Thiel's <em>Zero to One</em>.
      I decided to answer his 7 questions all startups should answer. 
      Below is an answer to The Engineering Question: <em>Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?</em>
      Of course, all this is almost certainly not going to pan out as imagined. 
      But it was fun to think about. 
    </p><p>
        <h3>Build a new kind of experience of the ocean</h3>
    </p><p>
        Google Maps when first released provided a new experience of being in the world, on land. 
        The experience of high quality situational awareness for drivers and pedestrians. 
        With digital maps and GPS localization on mobile devices, navigating on land became at least 10x better vs. paper maps and no localization. 
        We now have visual instructions at the point of need. 
        We escape the flatland of paper maps, to see a whole new view of the world from the perspective of a bird flying above at all times. 
        The experience of getting around and doing things on land is now easy, stressless. We feel more confident, safer. 
    </p><p>
        Some of this experience has been built and designed for the ocean environment, with digital maps and localization for boats and ocean infrastructure. 
        But something important is missing. 
        Whereas landscapes don't tend to move, oceanscapes move everywhere all the time. 
        And oceanscapes, or ocean weather conditions, are still unpredictable at the local real-time level. 
        That is, waves, currents and winds make doing almost anything on the ocean hard and expensive.  
        To reproduce our experience of digital land maps for the ocean environment, the topography of the ocean surface needs to be dynamic. 
        Which means the ocean surface needs to be mapped / measured / modeled locally in real time. 
    </p><p>
        <div class="img-center">
            <img src="wairo/maps.png" alt="Maps">
        </div>
    </p><p>
        Some products exist that do this, but they are prohibitively expensive and impractical for most boats and ocean infrastructure. 
        Further, they don't provide anywhere near the experience of interacting with Google Maps, with its content-responsive high-dimensional data graphics. 
        Digital land maps model geography, directly positioning words / numbers / lines / colors / symbols, zoomed-out overviews and zoomed-in detail, with seamless transitions of zoom-responsive content in between. 
        100s of layers of information fused into an immediately understandable picture. 
        Digital ocean maps of the seafloor and geographical features offshore do this too, sort of. 
        But the most important information is missing from these digital maps: the dynamic ocean surface. 
    </p><p>
        What if we could bring to bear the quality of digital land maps to the dynamic ocean environment?
    </p><p>
        We build dynamic, digital ocean surface maps. One day, of the whole ocean surface, updating real-time, with data from constellations of vessels and satellites, and AI making it all work beautifully, filling in all the gaps.  
        In doing so, we transform the way people interact with and perceive the ocean environment. 
        We create an immersive and awe-inspiring experience that captures the ocean's beauty, its ever-changing complexity, and its significance to our planet. 
        We build a technology that helps people at sea work and play with confidence. 
        We build technology that flings open Huxley's doors and allows us to truly understand the language of the ocean. 
    </p><p>
        <h3>A good technology is a technology that learns</h3>
    </p><p>
        Despite the world being complex, diverse, evolving and long tailed, humans are effective at navigating the world mostly flawlessly, even in new scenarios. 
        Why? Because we learn, adapt, build mental models of our environment. 
        Our thinking-eyes spot new patterns, develop new tricks, relate new unfamiliar things with old familiar things. 
        The world is somehow always a bit different in every moment, yet we adapt to it with ease, mostly without any conscious deliberation at all.
    </p><p>
        For the longest time, products were static in the sense that they didn't get better with time. 
        Most products today are still like this. 
        They are designed with assumptions about how the world is, built accordingly, and shipped off into the marketplace, with their peak performance already behind them.
    </p><p>
        With AI, however, products can get better with time. 
        These products are designed and built in a similar way, with assumptions about the world, but they also embed way more information about the world into their design, real-world data. 
        In some sense the product 'learns' about the world before it is even shipped. 
        Next comes the real magic. 
        When a product enters the wild and continues to 'learn' based on its 'experience', it gets better over time. 
        Its peak performance is weeks, months, possibly years ahead. 
        This is a fundamentally new kind of product than we're used to. 
        We're used to things running down, wearing out, bits and pieces breaking off - entropy is a harsh mistress. 
        But a product that integrates AI and online learning, a thing that actually gets better the more you use it (up to a point, entropy always wins in the end), gives users a great experience of the product and, by extension, the world. 
    </p><p>
        We build adaptive technology that learns over time. 
        Not just machine learning models (<a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">software 2.0</a>), but the whole technology, by automating as much of the machine learning pipeline as possible. 
        Everything from data collection and labeling to retraining and validation. 
        Example: Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) product. 
        Tesla outlines this in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBklltKXtDE">Operation Vacation</a>, where each step in the pipeline, from data collection to validation, can be automated (and all the engineers can go on vacation, except the essential manual labelers). 
        The idea is to design a system that scales with data, not engineering labor. 
    </p><p>
        A primary cost driver for ML products is data collection and labeling. 
        If users can do the data collecting and the system is designed such that autolabeling is possible, we can cut the cost of and speed up continuous iterative improvement.
    </p><p>
        What this looks like for Wairo is the following, using the mapping product as an example. 
        The cameras can be installed such that 3D information can be extracted, using stereo / multi-view geometry. 
        This 3D information is effectively the labels for further training, ie, autolabeling. 
        Thus, users using the product as normal also collect both data and labels that can be added to the training set. 
        Neural nets can be retrained / fine-tuned on this new data, tested and validated, and deployed into production, automatically. 
        The cycle repeats. Occurring in parallel is the loop of simulations > training data > model improvement.
    </p><p>
        <h3>AI is a tool for better thinking and decisions, not a substitution.</h3>
    </p><p>
        Humans can do many things, computers too. 
        Computers outperform humans on many narrow tasks, from calculations to data processing and manufacturing. 
        Increasingly, computers with AI are broadening their narrow abilities, becoming proficient at a spooky number of very human abilities, including creativity. 
        A naive view of this trend might conclude that computers and AI are, or soon will be, a substitution for human thinking and decisions. 
        This is profoundly mistaken.
    </p><p>
        Peter Thiel: 
    </p><p>
        <blockquote cite="Zero to One">
            <p><em>…computers are far more different from people than any two people are different from each other: men and machines are good at fundamentally different things. 
                People have intentionality—we form plans and make decisions in complicated situations. 
                We're less good at making sense of enormous amounts of data. 
                Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at efficient data processing, but they struggle to make basic judgments that would be simple for any human.
            </em></p>
        </blockquote>        
    </p><p>
        Thus, we are in the business of building AI tools that empower individuals and organizations to make more informed and intelligent decisions. 
        We build tools that compliment people's thinking and decisions, not automate them away. 
        Specifically, we build AI-enabled products that provide the right information at the right level of detail at the right time on a well-designed UI. 
        People use this information to help them do what they do, better. 
    </p><p>
        Computers and AI are tools, not rivals. 
        Neither human intelligence by itself nor AI alone can truly make sense of the complexity of the ocean. 
        By combining human thinking and skills with AI capabilities, we can find new levels of innovation and problem-solving potential. 
    </p><p>
        <h3>Healthy communication, from bits to brains and beyond</h3>
    </p><p>
        Sophistication scales with the effectiveness of communication. 
        We see this everywhere, from plants and animals to brains and neural networks to cities and civilizations. 
        The more communication channels, the higher the bandwidth, and the more diverse the messages that can be sent and received, the greater the sophistication that emerges. 
        Human language affords vast communication, which no doubt has been a key driver of the emergence of sophisticated civilizations. 
        Communication technologies and the internet have produced almost inconceivable sophistication.  
    </p><p>
        Complex systems like brains and civilizations thrive on healthy communication channels and fast bandwidth.
        But if signals are corrupted somehow (neural circuits fail, propaganda, censorship), strange and terrible consequences can ensue. 
    </p><p>
        What does this mean in the context of a breakthrough technology? Effective communication is required at <em>every level:</em>
    </p><p>
        <em>Sensors, circuits, bits.</em> Communication at the interfaces between the world, hardware, and software, must be robust and flexible. 
        Hardware for sensing the world and for supporting or controlling electrical signals must be robust so that what the system is designed to do, it does, for as long as possible. 
        A robust world/hardware communication interface is a foundation on which to build great software. 
        The design of hardware and the hardware/software communication interface should be flexible enough to allow for vast software optionality and extensibility (vast communication channels and bandwidth). 
    </p><p>
        <em>Code.</em> Making code readable is as important as making it executable.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> 
        This kind of communication must be agile and easily maintainable, because no plan ever has come out unscathed against reality. 
    </p><p>
        <em>Internal technical communications.</em> An example of terrible internal communications: large meetings where one person sprays the audience with bullets (which feel real sometimes) and some pretty pictures. 
        Information exchange asymptotically approaches zero. Serious meetings should begin with a silent reading period of a substantial document, 2-8 pages, using paragraphs, sentences and data. 
        No bullet lists, no slide decks, no rehearsals, no dumb slides.<sup><a href="#fn2">2,</a><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>
    </p><p>
        <em>Pixels, UIs, copy.</em> Edward Tufte's books<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> will also be our guide to information displays. 
        Everything will be refreshingly beautiful and useful. 
        Beautiful, because information that lacks beauty dies in the eye of the beholder. 
        Useful, so users can easily comprehend complex information displays that get it right. 
        The data is accurate and is shown accurately, resulting in better thinking and decisions. 
        Beautiful, useful displays of information is non-negotiable. 
        If we get this right, internally and externally, it will be a key differentiator.
    </p><p>
        <h3>Networks, networks everywhere</h3>
    </p><p>
        Networks create exponential possibilities. Brains. Roads. The internet. Social media. 
        Wairo will capitalize on several kinds of networks across several levels:
    </p><p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Neural networks
            </li>
            <li>
                Network of ocean sensors
            </li>
            <li>
                Network effects
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p><p>
        <em>Neural networks.</em> We build neural networks to help make sense of the complexity of the ocean, across all practical space and time scales. 
    </p><p>
        <em>Network of ocean sensors.</em> We build products that are connected in a network of users/units, so that users can see not only what the ocean is like around them but what it's like wherever other users are. 
        A network with more nodes is a better/antifragile network. 
        Interestingly, there is quite possibly a neural network architecture that models this level of network (the fleet level), that predicts ocean surface conditions in the space between nodes - a sophisticated kind of data-driven interpolation. 
    </p><p>
        <em>Network effects.</em> We bake into the DNA of Wairo a strong network effect:
    </p><p>
        <div class="img-center" style="max-width: 300px;">
            <img src="wairo/network.png" alt="Network effects">
        </div>
    </p><p>
        Metcalfe's law says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. 
        Each additional user/node creates compoundingly more value for everyone else already there. 
        When we establish the flywheel above, we build a moat around Wairo through strong network effects. 
    </p><p>
        <h3>Trust is important, especially offshore</h3>
    </p><p>
        Imagine you are offshore caught in a storm, getting thrashed around by a tumultuous sea, sideways rain making divots in your face and eyes and your boat, you haven't slept in over 24 hours. 
        Then your navigation and communication system stops working. Ya fucking kidding me!! 
    </p><p>
        When some critical piece of equipment stops working offshore, everything gets 10x harder and riskier. 
        So offshore products must be reliable. They must withstand the onslaught of the ocean environment. 
        Presumably, then, trust in an offshore product is hard won. 
        If a product cannot be relied upon, no one is going to trust it. 
        They very may well chuck it over board and let it sink, along with the business reputation. 
    </p><p>
        Therefore, reliability must be core to Wairo's products over the long term. Think Six Sigma and lean manufacturing. 
    </p><p>
        <h3>Develop 3 layers of customers</h3>
    </p><p>
        There are 3 layers of customers Wairo can serve:
    </p><p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Ocean sensing and visualization technology 
            </li>
            <li>
                Ocean data
            </li>
            <li>
                Ocean weather intelligence SaaS
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p><p>
        Layer 1 is straightforward. 
        Businesses, governments and individuals buy our ocean sensing technology, and put it on their vessels or ocean infrastructure.
    </p><p>
        Layer 2, ocean data, emerges from the first layer. 
        By connecting all our first layer products into an ocean sensor network, we collect a big ocean surface dataset. 
        This dataset will be big, diverse, unique, with high spatiotemporal resolution. 
        It makes sense to make this layer as open and accessible as possible, via data APIs and SDKs, and contribute to the global coordinated efforts in ocean observations, like the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS). 
        If individuals and organizations - blue economy businesses, engineers, scientists, governments, modelers, forecasters, ocean enthusiasts - use this data layer and build on it, then we become a dependency. 
        Our value, then, increases with the value they provide others. 
        Increased demand for this data increases demand for more sensors (layer 1) and better ocean weather intelligence (layer 3). 
    </p><p>
        Layer 3, ocean weather intelligence, emerges from the layers beneath. 
        We build software on top of everything to provide ocean insights, analytics, recommendations, and such like. 
        This layer of our products and services is the most expensive with the highest margins. 
    </p><p>
        <h3>Be full stack</h3>
    </p><p>
        Anyone serious about software should build their own hardware. Apple. Tesla. 
        Software may be eating the world, but it's possible it might run out of things to eat. 
        Wairo will ultimately be a software company, but one which happens to have lots of ocean sensing nodes (vessels with our hardware).
    </p><p>
        Thus, we build end-to-end, hardware-software integrated technology that bypasses incumbents and other competitors. 
        Hardware in our case is not like an autonomous car, it is far more humble. 
        It is essentially an assembly of cheap and abundant things: sensors, edge computers, IoT devices, UIs, housings, brackets. 
        With complete control, or as close as possible, we can deliver a much better experience, higher value.  
    </p><p>
        The hard thing about being full stack is that it requires substantial capital and in-house capabilities for hardware and software, design, supply chain management, sales and marketing, distribution, partnerships, etc. 
        But the payoff is that it is extremely hard for competitions to copy and implement all the interlocking pieces. 
    </p><p>
