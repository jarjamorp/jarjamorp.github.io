    <h2>SleepBullet</h2>
    <p>Jan 2021. Fiction.</p>
    <p>A tale of myopism and iatrogenesis.</p>

      'I am soon going to die, and that makes me a lucky one. Most people like me are already dead.'
    </p><p>
      This is how I will begin the ah…the preface.
    </p><p>
      Glad this dammed autobiography is nearly done. To thinkwrite without ah…errors takes me too many
tries I care to ah…to admit. My poor aging brain feels like it's sparking wrongly, nearing the end of
a…an unchoreographed neighbourhood fireworks show.
    </p><p>
      Can't bare to ah…thinkwrite the rest of the ah preface. Too slow, painful. Instead, I ah…will use
dad's ah…journal entries concerning SleepBullet. Like ah…Alan Watts' father who wrote the ah
preface to his autobiography. This will ah…neatly begin to tell the story of my life, my short life
    </p><p>

      Finally ah…read dad's ah…journals. It made me ah…um…resent my parents…Zenith and
Erica…even more. For their ah…um…stupid short thinking and their um…ah…worship of
SleepBullet. Here I am, 40, and ah…well…you know…everything…every thing…about me is old
except my ah…mmm…my eyes…that…which are cheerful and ah…undefeated. Stop. Remember,
don't die ah…um…a bitter man. Be ah…grateful…grateful you were ah…even born a human at all.
    </p><p>
      Dad's ah…selected journal ah…entries are co…copied below.

      Today Erica told me about a new sleep app, SleepBullet. It's bizarre: 'The eight-hour sleep is dead,
long live the four-hour sleep! SleepBullet manipulates your brainwaves to accelerate your sleep. No
additional devices required.'
    </p><p>
      Curious, I downloaded it, $4.95. Should probably research it before using, but it's harmless for the
first 13 nights. Will research next week. All I do is put my phone on charge and under my pillow.
    </p><p>

      First four-hour sleep tonight. Sceptical, as all Bayesian's ought to be, but also excited…
    </p><p>
      The science seems sound. Dozens of peer-reviewed papers on medRxiv, and upcoming Phase III
trials. Most compelling study: <em>The four-hour sleep night: neuroemumodulation shortens sleep by
50%.</em> Participants (n=963) beta tested the app, which functioned as normal for the randomly assigned
experimental group, but for the control group its functionality was disabled (placebo). Fully 97.5% of
the experimental group reported feeling the same or better than baseline, and memory and learning
were unaffected. Impressive. The control group reported feeling, unsurprisingly, chronically sleep
deprived, and memory and learning fell off a precipice.
    </p><p>
      SleepBullet is sophisticated, utilising recent advances in miniaturisation, power, and shielding of
magnetisation. It works in two phases:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The 13-night neuroemulation phase, in which the user's brain activity is measured, mapped,
        and modelled. SleepBullet uses micro-magnetoencephalography (with a supersensitive
        magnetometer normally used for navigation) to measure the user's brain activity during sleep
        and ambient magnetic noise. Using entropy-based signal-extraction techniques, SleepBullet
        filters the noise, so the brain's tiny magnetic fields sing like cicadas in the quite magnetic
        night. The brainwaves are fed into SleepMind, a supercomputer that creates a one-to-one
        model of the user's brain – a virtual copy.
        </li><li>
          The neuromodulation phase, in which the user's brain is modulated to accelerate sleep cycles.
Focused transcranial magnetic stimulation effectively penetrates the skull, enabling
neuromodulation, both depolarisation and hyperpolarisation. Spatial-temporal, small
population-neuron stimulation precision is achieved using a stereo-superconducting magnet (2
Tesla) constructed from very high-temperature superconducting tape (a micro-Faraday cage
provides magnetic shielding to avoid wiping everything on the phone). Then, using the
emulation model, modulating magnetic fields are induced in the user's brain that accelerate
sleep cycles. In effect, the brain (and body) subjectively experiences the normal five, 90-
minute sleep cycles, but in half the time. God turns the time dial from 1 to 2.
        </li>
      </ol>

      Noted, my gut feels strange, its intuitive tentacles fondling my heart and tapping my brain, tap, tap,
tap, like dad tapping his ornate barometer.

      Thursday, early, writing desk. Early as in 03:15 early. Woke up at 03:00, refreshed. Is SleepBullet, truly, a free lunch?

      <b>Zenith's Journal > 09 Jul 2027</b>

      Loving SleepBullet. With the sacred early mornings now so long, I often enter a deep state of
thinking/writing for the PhD. And plenty of time for play and love after work.
    </p><p>
      Erica and I now take long, slow walks after dinner. We discuss big questions. Last night: who or what
are the arbiters of truth, and why? Walking surely staves off the rust.
    </p><p>
      Worried about Erica, though. She vomited the past two mornings.
    </p><p>
      <b>Zenith's Journal > 23 Jun 2028</b>
    </p><p>
      Eucalypta isn't sleeping. He cries and cries and cries. I'm tired. Stressed. Erica is at her wits end.
    </p><p>
      Searched for studies on the safety and efficacy of SleepBullet on babies. Only one, but it's quality
work. Will raise it with Erica on the weekend.
    </p><p>
      <b>Zenith's Journal > 31 Dec 2028</b>
    </p><p>
      End of a momentous year! Eucalypta born (and sleeping beautifully). PhD done. Hundreds of art
pieces made. Stacks of books read. More quality time with Erica. SleepBullet really is a miracle.
    </p><p>
      Around the world, scientific publications skyrocketed, markets swelled, and world records were
smashed at the Los Angeles Olympics.
    </p><p>
      What joys will 2029 bring?
    </p><p>

      Eucalypta's second birthday party today. Got him a push bike and a new phone with upgraded
      hardware for SleepBullet. Strapped the legrope off my surfboard to his handlebars and ran down the
      road, him beaming behind.
    </p><p>
      Had an interesting conversation with Jack's mum, Jelinda. We ranted, indignantly, about the workday
      being extended by two hours. About freedoms, changing expectations, hyperproductivity. I said that,
      being an engineer, I love my machines efficient and optimised. But humans are not machines; we are
      thinking feeling animals, who sometimes like to stop and watch the bees. Jelinda said absolute power
      makes the powerful forget that they, too, are human beings. Don't they know what happens when it is
      all work and no play?
    </p><p>
      <b>Zenith's MindRecordings > Journal > 14 May 2046</b>
    </p><p>
      The evidence is ah…is irrefutable: SleepBullet causes ah…causes accelerated aging.
    </p><p>
      How do I ah…um…tell Eucalypta, just 18, that he ah…he um…probably won't ah…outlive me and
Erica?
